Time for some practice questions again! The questions on this page will help you review the concepts covered in the Control Flow lesson. These questions may use concepts from everything covered so far.

You may find these questions on the challenging end, but we have provided solutions for them on the next page. We encourage you to give them a good try, but if you get stuck or need a hint, do not hesitate to look at the solutions.

The following questions are based on data on Oscar Award Nominations for Best Director between the years 1931 to 2010. To start you off, we've provided a dictionary called "nominated" with the year (as key) and list of directors who were nominated in that year (as value). We've provided you with a different dictionary called "winners" with the year (as key) and list of directors who won the award in that year (as value).

Helpful hint:

    You may find it helpful to use a paper and pen to think through the logic of the for loop instead of directly trying to type out your code. for loops are tricky, but if you take the time to slowly work out the question's logic, and write out what is happening with each iteration in the for loop, it's easier to think through the code.

Practice Questions
Question 1.
    A. Create a dictionary that includes the count of Oscar nominations for each director in the nominations list.
    B. Provide a dictionary with the count of Oscar wins for each director in the winners list.

Question 2:
    Provide a list with the name(s) of the director(s) with the most Oscar wins. We are asking for a list because there could be more than 1 director tied for the most Oscar wins.
